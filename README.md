# APC_2025-2026_T1_SISTEM_IskoLAR

IskoLAR aims to provide a centralized, web-based platform that streamlines scholarship management for both scholars and program administrators. The system will allow scholars to submit requirements online, track their application status, receive important announcements, and communicate with program coordinatorsâ€”all in one secure platform. For administrators, the system will facilitate easier verification, record management, and reporting.
 
While the core system focuses on digitizing processes, the project also seeks to explore innovative features. One potential enhancement under consideration is the integration of an AI-powered assistant that allows scholars to conveniently inquire about deadlines, requirements, or application status using their student number. This will improve accessibility, reduce repetitive inquiries, and enhance overall user experience.
